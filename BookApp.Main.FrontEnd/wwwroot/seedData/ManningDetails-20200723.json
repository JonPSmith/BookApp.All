With proper planning, however, you can build in security from the start. Learn to create secure services and protect application data throughout development and deployment. \r\n\r\nAs microservices continue to change enterprise application systems, developers and architects must learn to integrate security into their design and implementation. Because microservices are created as a system of independent components, each a possible point of failure, they can multiply the security risk. With proper planning, design, and implementation, you can reap the benefits of microservices while keeping your application data\u2014and your company\u2019s reputation\u2014safe!",

You've also got to incorporate event-time processing to make sure that your stream processing system is every bit as accurate as a batch processing system.

Next, you'll get hands-on by creating your own Flink project using step-by-step instructions and lots of annotated images. With the basics well in hand, you'll move on to advanced topics like the Flink API, Kafka, and fault tolerance.

You\u2019ve chosen the old employee profile Java web app as your first conversion project, supplying a RESTful API that can provide read-and-update capabilities to other services and applications. Your challenges in this liveProject will include reviewing and modernizing the legacy app with Spring Boot and RESTful APIs, Dockerizing the app to run in a container environment, deploying it onto Kubernetes, and then testing that it\u2019s working properly.",

Even more exciting is the wide availability of platforms for developing voice-enabled apps. More important than great dev tools, however, is understanding how to design great voice apps. And the best way to learn is by exploring real-world voice experiences and proven development strategies.<br/><br/>\r\n \r\n<i>Exploring Voice-First Development</i> provides you with three chapters expertly picked by <b>Ann Thym\u00e9-Gobbel</b> and <b>Charles Jankowski</b> from their book, <i>Voice-First Development</i>. In this fast and focused sampler, these seasoned voice experts introduce you to core concepts of conversational voice before drilling down to key skills like handling vague, unclear or ambiguous user requests, and cultivating user confidence with meaningful confirmations. The examples in these chapters are based on real world voice solutions, offering code and design techniques as well as tips for avoiding common pitfalls as you blend design, development, and user concerns for voice-first success!",

It has been said that deep reinforcement learning, which is the use of deep learning and reinforcement learning techniques to solve decision-making problems, is the solution to the full artificial intelligence problem.<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nDeep reinforcement learning famously contributed to the success of AlphaGo and all its successors (AlphaGo, AlphaGo Zero, and AlphaZero, etc), which recently beat the world\u2019s best human player in the world\u2019s most difficult board game. But that is not the only thing you can do with deep reinforcement learning. These are some of the most notable applications:<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nLearn to play ATARI games just by looking at the raw image.<br/>\r\nLearn to trade and manage portfolios effectively.<br/>\r\nLearn low-level control policies for a variety of real-world models.<br/>\r\nDiscover tactics and collaborative behavior for improved campaign performance.<br/>\r\nFrom low-level control, to high-level tactical actions, deep reinforcement learning can solve large, complex decision-making problems.<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nBut deep reinforcement learning is an emerging approach, so the best ideas are still yours to discover. We can\u2019t wait to see how you apply deep reinforcement learning to solve some of the most challenging problems in the world.",

We avoid the things that cause us to experience pain and failure. We embrace and build on the things that give us reward and success. This common pattern is the foundation of deep reinforcement learning: building machine learning systems that explore and learn based on the responses of the environment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><i>Grokking Deep Reinforcement Learning</i> introduces this powerful machine learning approach, using examples, illustrations, exercises, and crystal-clear teaching.

Just like REST, GraphQL receives queries and returns resources; however, with GraphQL you can specify the resources you want in a single query without knowing anything about the way the servers are organized. Powerful, fast, and designed with modern development in mind, GraphQL-based systems are more flexible and developer-friendly than traditional REST-based architectures.",

What happened? Will it regain its power and again drive economic growth as in the past?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That's the surprising conclusion reached by Erik Keller, a central player in the booming IT world of the 1990s. Driven by fear of being left behind, American corporations let IT grow until it reached one half of all corporate capital spending by the year 2000. Now, chastened by their spending failures, IT managers are converging on a new consensus: to exploit IT competitively they must use their smarts over big money.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This shift in thinking comes just as free, open-source software, low-cost international programming labor, and new technologies combine to make the new approach possible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A former Research Fellow at Gartner, Keller had an insider's view of the irrational spending at many Fortune 500 companies, personally influencing billions of dollars of technology acquisitions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In <i>Technology Paradise Lost</i> Keller describes how the new thinking is working inside some of the country's most complex and successful organizations, including Merrill Lynch, JetBlue, Harrah's, and Motorola which have cut IT spending to gain a competitive edge, and experienced marked gains to their bottom lines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As it advances, the new IT think will cause further massive disruptions in the computer business, with fundamental changes in the ways software is developed, sold, and used. Efficiency of IT investment will grow as excess fat is squeezed out of IT salaries, software system costs, and consultants' fees.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In an unexpected twist, Keller argues that even as IT spending is reduced its importance for competitiveness will grow. Reduced spending does not mean IT has become a commodity. Counterintuitively, companies that spend less in order to get more from information technology will likely be the big winners.</p>",

        "description": "<p>In the classic style of Manning's \"In Action\" series, <i>NHibernate in Action</i> introduces .NET developers to the NHibernate Object/Relational Mapping tool.  As NHibernate is a port of Hibernate from Java to .NET, the book is based on Manning's bestselling <a shape='rect' href='/bauer'>Hibernate in Action</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><i>NHibernate in Action</i> begins by describing how to implement persistence in a layered .NET application.  The book then quickly springs into action by introducing NHibernate through a classic \"Hello World\" example. It explains how to configure NHibernate to specify the mapping information between business objects and database tables, and then explores the internal architecture of NHibernate. A complete example application is progressively built with Agile methodologies in mind, which shows readers all kinds of entity and relationship mappings and how to perform CRUD operations. The book also covers advanced techniques like caching, concurrency access, and isolation levels. The Hibernate Query Language (HQL) and criteria query APIs are thoroughly detailed with optimization tips.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The last chapters of this book discuss various development scenarios, how to implement the layers of an NHibernate application (covering Windows and Web development), and which tools are available for these tasks. They also provide some solutions for data-binding objects to .NET GUI controls, integrating services, and interacting with components using DataSets.  Finally, they explain how to build a complex application involving advanced session management and distributed transactions.</p>",

He worked with Flex full-time from July 2004 (since Flex 1.0) to October 2007 for a Silicon Valley startup, and was part of the team that won the 2006 Adobe MAX Award for RIA/Web Development. Before that, he was a Java Swing developer for over 4 years for another Silicon Valley startup. On the Rails side, Peter has been tracking Ruby on Rails since mid-2005 (since before Rails 1.0) and is the organizer of The Vancouver Ruby/Rails Meetup group. Peter is also a frequent speaker on using Flex and Rails together, including presentations at The Vancouver Flash/Flex Meetup, a RailsConf 2007 BOF, The Vancouver RIA Developer Camp and Rails to Italy in Pisa. Peter lives in the Vancouver, BC area and works as a Flex/AIR/Flash developer, writer (<a href='http://www.flexiblerails.com'>www.flexiblerails.com</a>) and independent consultant (<a href='http://www.ruboss.com'>www.ruboss.com</a>).</p>",

        "aboutTechnology": "Julia is a newcomer to the technical and scientific programming community currently dominated by R, Matlab, and Python. It was created with lofty goals: a general purpose, easy-to-learn open-source language that's blazingly fast and powerful and built with parallel computing and data science tasks in mind. Although Julia is a new language, its roots are in Lisp, so it comes with mature features like macros and support for other metaprogramming techniques like code generation. Julia's expressive grammar lets you write easy-to-read and easier-to-debug code, and its speed gets you through more work in less time. It's a great choice whether you're designing a machine learning system, crunching statistical data, or writing system utilities.",
        "description": "<i>Julia in Action</i> teaches you how to use the Julia language to tackle technical programming tasks as well as data processing, analysis, and visualization challenges. You'll begin by setting up your development environment and then you'll dive into the fundamentals: data types, strings, collections, matrices, and control flow. Using real-world examples, you'll learn how to create and use functions and methods along with how and when to use explicit types. You'll master reading and writing files and data, connecting to external data sources, and importing and cleaning real world data. This book also teaches you about parallel programming to help you split complex problems into distributable chunks for faster processing.  By the end of this book, you'll be ready to use Julia to solve your scientific programming tasks.",

We depend on applications like these to run correctly and efficiently, be easy to scale and modify, and last for the long haul. Industry giants including Facebook, IBM, Twitter, and Bank of America trust Haskell, a powerful functional programming language, for mission-critical software. Haskell blends a rigorous mathematical precision with the tools and approachability of a modern programming language. With its combination of lazy evaluation, highly expressive static type system, and zero side effects, Haskell invites you to approach programming from a fresh perspective!<br/><br/>\r\n \r\n<i>Exploring Haskell: Core Concepts</i> is a collection of hand-picked chapters from two Manning books. This excellent starter guide aims to tame Haskell's reputed steep learning curve by spotlighting how easy it is to get started with this powerful language. In it, you\u2019ll explore core concepts like type classes, derivation and polymorphism, composability with semigroups and monoids, lazy evaluation of I/O on the command line, and more. Finally, you\u2019ll take a close look at how to design a standalone, multi-module Haskell program incorporating external packages. Compiled by computer science expert Dr. Marcello Seri, Exploring Haskell: Core Concepts will help you get started with Haskell and decide if a deeper exploration of Haskell is for you.",
